I'm trying to use the Awake feature in Power Toys.  I have it set up to start up at Windows 11 Startup.  It's set up to delay sleep for 3 hours after startup.  I suppose this will only work once.   I want to repeat this delay at a later hour, say at 6 PM the same day.  How can this be done? 

All suggestions appreciated.
